        <div class="section">
            <h2>My Story: Why I'm Building This From My Car</h2>
            
            <div class="will-intro">
                <p>
                    My name is Will Price. I'm a strategic architect and problem solver. A month ago, I was fired for being a whistleblower. I worked as a live-in caregiver at a facility whose owner was harming vulnerable elderly people. I asked questions. I reported wrongdoing. And for protecting vulnerable people, I was retaliated against and kicked out.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Now I live in my car. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But here's what I know: For many years, I've been researching a path forward. Not just for myself, but for 244 million Americans ready for an alternative to what's destroying them. I've developed PHIERS—a self-sustaining healthcare system powered by collective buying through Mark Cuban.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The proof is real. The math is validated. The timing is perfect (Congress just failed on healthcare). But <strong>I can't build this alone.</strong>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="photo-section">

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why I'm a Whistleblower Fighting for This</h2>
            
            <div class="why-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>I saw healthcare destroy people.</strong> I watched families lose everything to medical debt. I watched people choose between buying medicine and buying food. I watched the system choose corporate profit over human life.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="why-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>When I spoke up, the system punished me.</strong> Not because I was wrong. But because I threatened the people profiting from that broken system. Whistleblowers get fired. We get silenced. We end up homeless. That's how the system protects itself.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="why-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>Now I'm solving it from the front seat of my car.</strong> Not waiting for government. Not waiting for legislation. Not waiting for politicians to find political will. I'm building the solution that 244 million Americans are ready for.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="why-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>But it can't happen without you.</strong> I can do the research. I can design the system. I can show you it works. But I can't build it alone. This needs movement. This needs 3.5% of people in each congressional district saying "we want this" loud enough that politicians have to listen.

                <p>
                    <strong>Congress just failed.</strong> Today (December 11), the Senate rejected both healthcare plans. Both failed. Now 22 million Americans face DOUBLED healthcare costs on January 1st. That's 20 days away. Government can't fix this. But cooperation can.

            </div>

            <div class="why-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>People are desperate for solutions NOW.</strong> AI is destroying jobs. Inflation is destroying purchasing power. DOGE is shredding the safety net. This isn't abstract anymore. This is immediate pain. This is maximum motivation to try something new.

                    <strong>The proof is operational.</strong> Mark Cuban's prescriptions savings work. Telehealth covers what most people need. The math funds everything. This isn't theory—it's proven and ready to scale.

            <h2>What We're Building Together</h2>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">This isn't about me surviving. It's about proving that:</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 2;">
                <li><strong>Whistleblowers deserve support, not homelessness</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Collective buying power beats corporate extraction</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare should be affordable for everyone</strong></li>
                <li><strong>3.5% of people organizing together is unstoppable</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Cooperation beats legislation every time</strong></li>
                <li><strong>We the People ARE stronger than the system</strong></li>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 1.05em;">
                That's what we're building. Not a charity. A movement. Not hope. Mathematical certainty. Not waiting for permission. Taking power back through collective choice.
